What is it?
-----------

PiXasso is an easy-to-use application which typesets snippets
of LaTeX code and creates pictures exportable in various formats
via drag-and-drop. Once created, snippets remain available
in the history and can be reused or modified.


How do I pronounce "PiXasso"?
-----------------------------

The "X" in PiXasso is the greek capital letter "chi", the same
appearing in TeX and LaTeX and, of course, it is pronounced
in the same way. So, PiXasso is read as the painter Picasso,
that is: pee-kah-sso.
